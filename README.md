# React Router Practice

This repository contains my practice projects for learning and implementing routing concepts in **React.js** using **React Router**.

## Features

- **React Router DOM**: Learn how to use `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
- **Basic Routing**: Implement basic navigation between pages.
- **Nested Routes**: Understand how to structure routes with child components.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Use dynamic routing to create parameterized URLs.
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Learn how to navigate programmatically using React Router hooks.
- **404 Pages**: Handle unknown routes by creating custom "Not Found" pages.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: Standard routing library for React.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript features like hooks, arrow functions, and destructuring.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (or yarn)
A code editor like VSCode
Installation
Clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-router-practice.git
    cd react-router-practice
    Install dependencies:
    
    
    npm install
    Start the development server:
    
    
    npm start
    This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000/.

Available Routes
Home Page (/): The landing page of the app.
About Page (/about): A simple page that provides information about the app.
Dynamic Route Example (/user/:id): Dynamic routing for user details.
404 Not Found (*): Catch-all route for handling unknown paths.
Concepts Covered
Basic Routing: Set up routes using <Route> and <Switch> (or <Routes> in newer versions).
Nested Routing: Add routes inside components for deeper navigation.
Route Parameters: Capture dynamic values from the URL and pass them as props.
Programmatic Navigation: Use useHistory or useNavigate to navigate programmatically.
Protected Routes: Implement simple authentication to protect certain routes.
Example Code
Here's a simple example of setting up routes in React:
